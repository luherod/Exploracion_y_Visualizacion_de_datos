# Analysis of Areas of improvement in Customer satisfaction

## About this project

This dashboard analyzes the areas of improvement in customer satisfaction.

In the **'Customer Review'** screen, the KPIs shown are:

* The percentage of vacation rentals with an overall rating lower than 80%.
* The average grade of each field that the customer can evaluate for vacation rentals with an overall rating lower than 80%.

In the **'Location'** screen, you can see the top 5 worst-rated locations in the accommodation reviews, as well as their grades.

Swiping over the location bars, a tooltip appears showing the map of the area and the available accommodations in that area. Accommodation dots on the map are colored according to the location rating (color scale from red to green).

In the **'Cleanliness'** screen, there is a graphic showing the number of accommodations per cleanliness grade.

Swiping over a cleanliness grade category in the bar, a tooltip shows how many of the accommodations with that cleanliness grade include a cleaning fee.

In the **'Value for Money'** screen, you can see how the prices are distributed for accommodations with a global rating lower and higher than 80%, based on the value-for-money grade.

If any price range does not exist in both the lower-than-80% and higher-than-80% graphics, it is colored according to the global rating (red or green palettes).

This screen also displays a histogram with the price distribution of accommodations with a global rating lower than 80%.
